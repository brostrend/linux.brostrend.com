# Supported architectures

As stated on our [Amazon product
pages](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCN6WGX/ref=ask_ql_qh_dp_hza), our
drivers are only supported on PCs (x86_32, x86_64) and Raspberry Pi 2+ (armhf,
aarch64). You may try to [run our installer](/) before buying the adapters if
you wish, to see if it successfully installs the driver or not.

See also the [supported distributions](supported-distributions) page.
