<h1>How-to install BrosTrend WiFi Adapter in Linux</h1>
<p>Instructions on how to install the following adapters in Debian or
Ubuntu based Linux distributions:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>AC1 Model: BrosTrend 1200Mbps USB WiFi Network Adapter;
	Dual Band AC 5GHz WiFi Speed 867Mbps, 2.4GHz 300Mbps.</p>
	<li/>
<p>AC3 Model: BrosTrend 1200Mbps Long Range USB Wireless
	Internet Adapter; AC 1200 Dual Band 5GHz Wireless Speed 867Mbps,
	2.4GHz 300Mbps; 2 X 5dBi WiFi Antenna.</p>
</ul>
<p>Please note that <b>an Internet connection is required at the time
of installation</b>, so as to be able to download the driver and its
dependencies. That means that you might have to use a wired
connection, i.e. a LAN cable.</p>
<p>The instructions should work in any distributions that are based
on Debian 9 (Stretch) or on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) or on newer
versions of them. The supported architectures are PCs (x86_32,
x86_64) and Raspberry Pi 2+ (armhf). Our repository is automatically
added to your software sources, so as to enable automatic driver
updates.</p>
<p>In case you need any other assistance in using this BrosTrend WiFi
adapter, please do not hesitate to contact us by sending an email at
<a href="mailto:support@trend-tech.net.cn">support@trend-tech.net.cn</a>.
Our technical support team will reply to you as soon as possible. In
case of a failed installation, please attach all the terminal output
so that our team can see what went wrong.</p>
<h2 class="western">Installation steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p>Do not plug in the WiFi adapter yet.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Select all the following line and right click → copy it
	to the clipboard:</p>
	<p><tt class="western">sh -c 'wget deb.trendtechcn.com/installer.sh
	-O /tmp/installer.sh &amp;&amp; sh /tmp/installer.sh'</tt></p>
	<li/>
<p>Press Alt+F2 to invoke your distribution's “Execute
	command” dialog, or open a terminal. Right click → paste the
	previous command in order to execute it.</p>
	<li/>
<p>The installer requires root rights, so it will ask for your
	password. It will then automatically download and install the driver
	for you.</p>
	<li/>
<p>When the installer finishes, insert the WiFi adapter into a
	USB slot. The driver should be automatically loaded, but in special
	cases, a reboot might be necessary.</p>
</ol>
<h2 class="western">Deb package</h2>
<p>The driver actually comes in a .deb package:
<a href="https://deb.trendtechcn.com/rtl8812au-dkms.deb">https://deb.trendtechcn.com/rtl8812au-dkms.deb</a>.
But please use the installer to download and install it, as it has
some additional logic to detect and install the required kernel
header packages. You may examine the <a href="https://deb.trendtechcn.com/installer.sh">installer
source code</a> if you want to see the exact shell commands that it
runs.</p>
