<h1>How-to install BrosTrend WiFi Adapter in Linux</h1>
<p>Instructions on how to install the following adapters in Debian or
Ubuntu based Linux distributions:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>AC1 Model: BrosTrend 1200Mbps USB WiFi Network Adapter;
	Dual Band AC 5GHz WiFi Speed 867Mbps, 2.4GHz 300Mbps.</p>
	<li/>
<p>AC3 Model: BrosTrend 1200Mbps Long Range USB Wireless
	Internet Adapter; AC 1200 Dual Band 5GHz Wireless Speed 867Mbps,
	2.4GHz 300Mbps; 2 X 5dBi WiFi Antenna.</p>
	<li/>
<p>AC5 Model: BrosTrend 1200Mbps Long Range USB Wireless
	Internet Adapter; AC 1200 Dual Band 5GHz Wireless Speed 867Mbps,
	2.4GHz 300Mbps.</p>
</ul>
<p>Please note that <b>an Internet connection is required at the time
of installation</b>, so as to be able to download the driver and its
dependencies. That means that you might have to use a wired
connection, i.e. a LAN cable.</p>
<p>The instructions should work in any distributions that are based
on Debian 9 (Stretch) or on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) or on newer
versions of them. The latest supported kernel is 5.3.x, which is the one
shipped by Ubuntu 19.10. The supported architectures are PCs (x86_32,
x86_64) and Raspberry Pi 2+ (armhf). It's reported to work in some other
architectures as well, like BeagleBone or Nvidia Jetson, but it's not
officially supported there. Our repository is automatically
added to your software sources, so as to enable automatic driver
updates.</p>
<p>In case you need any other assistance in using this BrosTrend WiFi
adapter, please do not hesitate to contact us by sending an email at
<a href="mailto:support@trend-tech.net.cn">support@trend-tech.net.cn</a>.
Our technical support team will reply to you as soon as possible. In
case of a failed installation, please attach all the terminal output
so that our team can see what went wrong.</p>
<h2>Installation steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p>Insert the WiFi adapter into a USB slot.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Select all the following line and right click → copy it
	to the clipboard:</p>
	<p><tt>sh -c 'wget deb.trendtechcn.com/installer.sh
	-O /tmp/installer.sh &amp;&amp; sh /tmp/installer.sh'</tt></p>
	<li/>
<p>Press Alt+F2 to invoke your distribution's “Execute
	command” dialog, or open a terminal. Right click → paste the
	previous command in order to execute it.</p>
	<li/>
<p>The installer requires root rights, so it will ask for your password.
	It will then automatically download and install the driver for you.
	When the installer finishes, the driver should be automatically loaded,
    but in special cases, a reboot might be necessary.</p>
	<li/>
<p>If the installer reported an error, please copy all the text in the terminal
    and paste it in a mail to <a href="mailto:support@trend-tech.net.cn">support@trend-tech.net.cn</a>,
    so that we can see what went wrong.</p>
</ol>
<h2>Deb packages</h2>
<p>The drivers are actually packaged in .deb format:
<a href="https://deb.trendtechcn.com/rtl8812au-dkms.deb">rtl8812au-dkms.deb</a> for the AC1 Model, <a href="https://deb.trendtechcn.com/rtl88x2bu-dkms.deb">rtl88x2bu-dkms.deb</a> for AC3 and <a href="https://deb.trendtechcn.com/rtl8821cu-dkms.deb">rtl8821cu-dkms.deb</a> for AC5.
But please use the installer to download and install them, as it has
some additional logic to detect and install the required kernel
header packages. You may examine the <a href="https://deb.trendtechcn.com/installer.sh">installer
source code</a> if you want to see the exact shell commands that it
runs.</p>
