<h2>Secure boot installation issues</h2>
<p>Newer computer systems with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface">UEFI
firmware</a> sometimes have <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot">secure
boot</a> enabled that prohibits code to be loaded if it’s not
signed by Microsoft. To bypass that, Linux distributions have a
pre-loader called <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot/ShimUpdateProcess">shim</a>
that gets signed by Microsoft, and which in turn can load code signed
by the distribution, such as Canonical or Debian kernels and kernel
modules.</p>
<p>This means that to compile and load external drivers like
rtl8812au wifi, that are not signed by the Linux distributions, you
would need to:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>Disable secure boot, or</p>
	<li/>
<p>Create you own signing key and sign the external drivers
	with it</p>
</ul>
<p>But before starting to execute one of these methods, let’s make
sure that you have secure boot enabled. Open a terminal and run this
command:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2cm"><tt>sudo mokutil --sb-state</tt></p>
<p>If it reports “SecureBoot enabled”, continue reading. If it
reports “SecureBoot disabled”, please stop and email us, as your
issue like isn’t related to secure boot.</p>
<h2>Disable secure boot</h2>
<p>If you choose to disable secure boot, you need to enter the UEFI
(BIOS) settings by pressing Del or some similar key when your
computer boots. For more information, see <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/891248/ubuntu-16-04-how-can-i-disable-secure-boot">this
askubuntu question</a>. After you disable secure boot, you might need
to run our installer again for the driver to load.</p>
<h2>Create DKMS signing key</h2>
<p>By default, when Ubuntu detects that the user tries to install an
external driver while secure boot is enabled, it shows the following
messages:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2cm">Configuring Secure Boot</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2cm">Your system has UEFI Secure Boot enabled.
UEFI Secure Boot requires additional configuration to work with
third-party drivers. The system will assist you in configuring UEFI
Secure Boot. To permit the use of third-party drivers, a new
Machine-Owner Key (MOK) has been generated. This key now needs to be
enrolled in your system's firmware. To ensure that this change is
being made by you as an authorized user, and not by an attacker, you
must choose a password now and then confirm the change after reboot
using the same password, in both the Enroll MOK and Change Secure
Boot state menus that will be presented to you when this system
reboots. If you proceed but do not confirm the password upon reboot,
Ubuntu will still be able to boot on your system but any hardware
that requires third-party drivers to work correctly may not be
usable.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2cm">Enter a password for Secure Boot. It will
be asked again after a reboot.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2cm">&gt; ********</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2cm">Enter the same password again to verify
you have typed it correctly.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2cm">&gt; ********</p>
<p>After you enter the password there, you’re supposed to reboot,
where you’ll see an UEFI dialog that prompts you to trust your new
key. After you trust it, run our installer again and it should work
fine.</p>
<p>You can find screenshots of this procedure in the Ubuntu
<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot/DKMS">SecureBoot
documentation page</a>.</p>
