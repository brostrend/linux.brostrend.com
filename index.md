# Installation

The following instructions install the appropriate drivers for the
[AC1L](https://www.brostrend.com/products/ac1l),
[AC3L](https://www.brostrend.com/products/ac3l),
[AC5L](https://www.brostrend.com/products/ac5l),
[AX1L](https://www.brostrend.com/products/ax1l),
[AX4L](https://www.brostrend.com/products/ax4l) and
[AX5L](https://www.brostrend.com/products/ax5l) BrosTrend Wi-Fi adapters in any
of the [supported distributions](supported-distributions). All the drivers and
the installer are open source (GPL); you may get the code from
[here](troubleshooting/source-code).

> üí° **Tip:** Linux kernels (>= 6.2) include their own drivers for our
> AC1L/AC3L/AC5L adapters, so they work out of the box in recent distributions.
> But these drivers aren't yet as mature as ours, so if you encounter any
> issues, use our installer to replace them.

## Installation steps

1. Please note that **an Internet connection is required at the time of
installation**, so as to be able to download the driver and its dependencies
(dkms, linux-headers...). That means that you might have to use a wired
connection (LAN cable) or [mobile phone wifi-to-usb
tethering](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-tether-your-smartphone-in-linux/).

2. We recommend to [update and reboot your system](troubleshooting/os-updates)
before running our installer, to avoid some common issues like mismatched
kernel headers or old http certificates.

3. [After](advanced/usb_modeswitch) the system has booted, insert the Wi-Fi
   adapter into a USB slot.

4. Select all the following line and right click ‚Üí copy it to the clipboard:

    ```shell
    sh -c 'wget linux.brostrend.com/install -O /tmp/install && sh /tmp/install'
    ```

5. Press Alt+F2 to invoke your distribution's ‚ÄúExecute command‚Äù dialog, or open
a terminal. Right click ‚Üí paste the previous command in order to execute it. If
it fails with "wget: command not found", please try one of the [alternative
installation commands](troubleshooting/alternative-installation-commands).

6. The installer requires root rights, so it will ask for your password. It
will then automatically download, install and load the correct driver for your
adapter. In some cases a reboot might be necessary.

7. If the installer reports an error, please copy all the text in the terminal
and paste it in a mail to [support@brostrend.com](mailto:support@brostrend.com)
so that we can see what went wrong. Please also attach the auto-generated log
file, /tmp/troubleshooting.txt.

If your distribution is based on Debian, our apt repository will be
automatically added to your software sources, to provide automatic driver
updates. For non-Debian distributions please re-run our installer whenever you
need to update to our latest drivers.

In case you need any assistance in using the BrosTrend Wi-Fi adapters, please do
not hesitate to contact us by sending an email at
[support@brostrend.com](mailto:support@brostrend.com).
