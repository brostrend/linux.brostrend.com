# Raspberry Pi kernel

In March 2023, Raspberry Pi OS introduced a [breaking
change](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=349291). Since then, if
**Pi4/5**, **Pi400/500** or **CM4/5** devices are booted with the **32bit OS**
image, the **64bit kernel** gets loaded by default. This architecture mismatch
between the 32bit OS and the 64bit kernel, causes all external drivers to
**fail to compile**, including ours. Only these devices are affected, and only
if they're booted with the 32bit OS image.

It's possible to undo this change by adding `arm_64bit=0` in the
`/boot/firmware/config.txt` file (or for older Raspberry Pi OS versions, in
`/boot/config.txt`). You can do that with any editor, or with the following
terminal commands:

    sudo -i
    config=/boot/firmware/config.txt
    test -f "$config" || config=/boot/config.txt
    sed '/arm_64bit/d' -i "$config"
    printf "[pi4]\narm_64bit=0\n" >>"$config"

Then reboot your device and re-run our installer; it should then work fine.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** If your device has at least 4 GB RAM, it's usually better to
> reinstall using the 64bit Raspberry Pi OS version, in order to have greater
> speed and to take advantage of all your RAM.
